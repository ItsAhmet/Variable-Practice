Problem #1: Class Percentage
Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the
class. Find the percentage of males and females in the class. Class total and the number of each gender should all be saved as variables

Expected Output
Percentage of males= 8/20 = %XX
Percentage of females= 12/20= %XX


Problem #2: Class average
Three students took a test; write a program to calculate the average of these three students. Each grade should be represented by an int variable. Each student should have a name assigned by a String variable


Expected Output:
Student1 got an 85
Student2 got a 78
Student3 got a 96

The class average on the test was XX.XX

Problem #3: Payroll
2 Employees are trying to figure out how much they should expect on their next paycheck. Write a program that calculates both of their paychecks based on the following data. Give the employees names using strings and save each number as a double type variable

Employee 1 worked 39.25 hours with a salary of 8.66 an hour
Employee 2 worked 34.50 hours with a salary of 9.23 an hour

Expected Output:
Employee #1
Hours worked= XX.XX
Hourly pay rate= X.XX
Gross Pay= XX.XX (you will most likely get a longer decimal point here)
*Note that you need to write this a second time for the other employee
